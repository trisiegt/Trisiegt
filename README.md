# Hey!
The name's **Tristan**, I make stuff!

## Projects
-- **Developer at [AstroSling Studios](https://modrinth.com/organization/astrosling)** (the creators of the now-defunct Astro Client for Minecraft)

-- **Now developer for *[Cappuchin](https://donut.pii.at/)*, a modpack/client in honor of Astro, for performance.**<br> 
.....Made with [Saturn](github.com/satucat)!

## About Me
Once again, I am Tristan. I love coding, and really tinkering with anything that runs Windows or Linux.
I've probably drunk half the world's supply of ***Irn Bru***.

Britain's the best.
Also I game! @tristanplayscs Steam
